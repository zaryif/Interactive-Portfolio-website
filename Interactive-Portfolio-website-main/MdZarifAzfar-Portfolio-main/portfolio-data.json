      "description": "As an advisor for the Josephite IT Club, I conceptualized and prototyped a web platform for managing our flagship national event, 'Technovation '25'. The goal was to streamline participant registration, event scheduling, and real-time announcements. I conducted research into the needs of both organizers and participants to design a user-centric interface. The platform was designed to handle a high volume of traffic during peak registration periods and to provide a seamless experience across all devices. This project involved system design, database schema planning, and front-end development.",
